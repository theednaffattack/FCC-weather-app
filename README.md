# Free Code Camp - Weather App

This is intended to satisfy the Free Code Camp Weather App challenge.

The code organization is difficult due to it being developed locally but project submissions are done via codepen.io which introduces a host of challenges.

For the moment I'm leaving things as-is where the app is modularized for local dev but bundled (it's ugly) for export to Codepen.  I'll have to come up with a better solution eventually.
